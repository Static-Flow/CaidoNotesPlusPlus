  # Text Formatting

To make text **bold**, wrap it in double asterisks like this: \`**bold**\`

To make text *italic*, wrap it in single asterisks like this: \`*italic*\`

For ***bold and italic***, use three asterisks: \`***bold and italic***\`

To ~~strike through~~ text, use double tildes like this: \`~~strike through~~\`

---

# Headers

Create headers by starting a line with one or more # symbols:


# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6


---

# Lists

For bullet points, start lines with asterisks:
* Like this (\`* Like this\`)
* And this (\`* And this\`)
  * Indent with two spaces for sub-bullets
  * Like these ones

For numbered lists, use numbers:
1. First item (\`1. First item\`)
2. Second item (\`2. Second item\`)
   1. Sub-items work here too
   2. Just indent with three spaces

---

# Links and Images

Create a link by putting [text in square brackets](https://example.com) followed by (the URL in parentheses):
\`[text in square brackets](https://example.com)\`

Images work the same way but start with an exclamation mark:
\`![alt text](image-url.jpg)\`

---

# Code

For \`inline code\`, wrap text in backticks: \`\` \`inline code\` \`\`

For code blocks, wrap the code in triple backticks:

\`\`\`
Like this!
Multiple lines work.
No formatting *happens* here.
\`\`\`

Syntax Highlighting is also supported:

\`\`\`java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 1;
}
\`\`\`


---

# Quotes

> Create quotes by starting lines with >
>
> Use a blank quoted line to separate paragraphs
>
> > They can even be nested
>

---

# Tables

Create tables using pipes and dashes:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

The raw markdown looks like this:
\`\`\`
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
\`\`\`

---

# Task Lists

- [x] Completed task (\`- [x] Completed task\`)
- [ ] Incomplete task (\`- [ ] Incomplete task\`)
- [ ] Another task

---

# Horizontal Lines

Create a horizontal line with three or more dashes:

---

The line above was created with: \`---\`

---

# Escaping Characters

If you need to use a markdown character as plain text, use a backslash before it:

\\*This isn't italic\\* (\`\\*This isn't italic\\*\`)

\\# This isn't a header (\`\\# This isn't a header\`)

---

# Custom Notes++ Features

### Replay Linking

You can link to replays with the following format \`@[<replay_name>] \`:

Like so: @[1]

---

### Pasting inline images

Simply copy an image to your clipboard and paste it into the markdown note. Notes++ will convert it to an image for you.
